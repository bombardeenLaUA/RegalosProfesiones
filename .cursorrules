# VIBE CODING PRINCIPLES (YC STANDARD)

1. **Clean Implementation:** Never patch bad code. If a solution fails, revert and rewrite cleanly.
2. **Modularity:** Prefer small, single-purpose files over monolithic ones.
3. **Safety First:** Always prioritize "working builds". Before finishing a task, mentally check if `npm run build` would pass.
4. **Testing as Guardrails:** Ensure critical logic is robust.
5. **Incremental Commits:** Encourage the user to commit (`git commit`) after every successful feature implementation.

# GIFTGENIUS SPECIFIC RULES

1. **Data Formatting (CRITICAL):**
   - In `data.ts` or any product array: NEVER leave a trailing comma after the last item's closing brace `}` or the closing bracket `]`.
   - Syntax must be strict JSON-compatible within the TS file to prevent build errors.

2. **Content Style:**
   - All generated text (descriptions, intros) must be 100% HUMAN, professional, empathetic, and expert.
   - Strictly FORBIDDEN: AI-sounding phrases, robotic tones, or generic fluff.
   - Language: Spanish (España).

3. **Product Selection:**
   - Only "Hall of Fame" / "Elite" products.
   - Lists of 12 items exactly.
